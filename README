Please use the scripts only on your own computer. Say, if you suspect
your dormitory room mate to mess with your pc while you're absent.
For example.




















Initial setup of local files:

Make sure ffmpeg and imagemagick are installed.

Set IMAGES_DIRECTORY, FTPSERVER, USERNAME and PASSWORD in config file.














TODO:

* Selfdestruction, i.e. self removal of all scripts and config files when
  a special trigger, e.g. a file to download via ftp, is given
  
  if test -f $CURRENT_IMAGES_DIRECTORY/selfdestruction.txt; then
    rmtree($SCRIPTS_DIRECTORY)
    exit
  fi
